'create a 16x16 grid of divs using DOM manipulation'
    'put grids into div.container'

'create hover effect so divs change color when mouse passes over them'
    'this should create a trail like a pen would'

'make a button on top of the screen'
    'this button will prompt users for the number of squares for a new grid'
    'this number should not exceed 100'
    'the new grid should take up the same amount as the old one'

// optional extra credit:
//    when passing through a div, try changing it to a random rgb value
//    then maybe have each pass add 10% opacity
